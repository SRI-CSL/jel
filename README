JPEG Embedding Library

This library supplies an API for embedding and extracting bit strings
into / from JPEG images.  The library uses heavily quantized frequency
components to provide storage that is stabilized by the JPEG
compression process.  As a result, embedded bit strings are preserved
under a number of different transformations, including transcoding to
higher quality, DC or low frequency shifts in pixel value, and limited
image rescaling.
